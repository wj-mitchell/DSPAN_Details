# NIH DSPAN (F99/K00) Application Materials
**NOTE:** Is there a specific reason that this needs to be hosted on Github? No. There's no code in here, but Dropbox was giving me trouble and can often times be inaccessible to people without accounts. Github seemed to me to be a means of making this publicly accessible and allowing me to maintain version control pretty easily. 

Any private or sensitive information contained within these documents (user IDs, addresses, signatures, etc.) has been removed for security concerns. If you see some section in which it looks like I forgot to include one of those things, it's probably because I removed it so use your best judgement. 

Lastly, the conventions and templates are changing not infrequently, so please consult with and trust official NIH resources (which this is not) when working on any of these documents moreso than anything I say. The purpose of this repository is to give people a starting point and reduce uncertainty about some of the unofficial or subjective aspects of the process (e.g., "How long do I have to wait to hear back?", "Will I have enough time to turn around a  resubmission if I don't get it the first time?", "How can I frame this tangetially related experience?", etc.)  

## Overview:

This directory contains almost all, if not all, of the documents related to my application to the [NIH DSPAN award](https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/training/nih-blueprint-and-brain-initiative-d-span-award-f99k00), which provides up to two years of predoctoral funding and four years of postdoctoral funding to eligible applicants (i.e., people who meet the NIH definition of being from a diverse background; see the [funding announcement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NS-21-012.html)). I specifically met criteria 3 through 7 under condition C and so my application carries with it that specific perspective, which might be something to keep in mind if your elgibility is granted by meeting different criteria. 

I applied twice: December 2022 and April 2023. My first submission was not discussed (i.e., did not receive an impact score) but my second submission received an impact score of 30 and was funded. The DSPAN does not give percentile scores like the NIH F31, so it can be hard to determine your likelihood of getting funded, but you can look at the [current paylines, or ballpark probability of funding, by impact score for the F99 grant at this link](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/determining-your-funding-likelihood/ninds-paylines). The external deadlines were December 15th and April 15th; though,  I had to have all materials completed for internal deadlines by the 08th of any given submission month. Our grant specialist handled most of this and submitted it through the [NIH Commons portal](https://public.era.nih.gov/commonsplus/public/login.era?TARGET=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.era.nih.gov%3A443%2Fcommonsplus). Here, you can see your application as well as any updates on the status of it. Reach out to Julia Ehrlanger early, at least a month in advance to your submission, so that she can five you more information on forms, internal deadlines, getting an NIH commons account, etc.; all of which take a lot longer than you think they would. 

## Timelines

The first submission was submitted December 15th, 2022. The study section met to discuss this submission on Februrary 13th, 2023 and I received my summary statement, which includes detailed feedback on every section, from that section on March 07th, 2023. Because it was not discussed, there was no advisory council meeting. I had between March 07th and April 08th to incorporate that study section feedback into my resubmission. I made some substantial changes to my advisory team, recommender team, and study design in that time. My next application was submitted April 15th, 2023. The study section fir that submission met on June 05th. I received my impact score June 10th and my summary statement on July 09th. I then recevied an email from the Program Officer, Michelle, Jones-London, on July 11th asking me to respond to the feedback in a three page letter by July 21st. The advisory council met sometime in August (which was not disclosed to me) and I learned via email on August 18th that the project was funded. During all of that time I did have two or three meetings with Michelle and Lauren Ulrich to discuss my application and get some more insight into parts of the application or feedback that confused me. 

## Materials

I have the contents of this directory split into a few subdirectories:

### Assistance
Assistance contains NIH-generated forms, guides, and information that I thought would be relevant to my application. Some of this may be outdated and I would check the NIH website for the most up-to-date versions of these things, but I thought including them to show what I was looking at while I was working on this could be helpful. I have an image of the `F31 guidelines` for document length, which are almost identical to this application, just for quick reference. I also have the `Funding Announcement` and a `list of tips` for building an application. There are three dense guides on completing `career`, `fellowship`, and `general` forms that are less helpful and I can't quite remember whether I actually used them at all.

### Just In Time Docs  
Once the application was accepted, I recevied an email from Pamela L Mayer at the NIH on September 7th requesting information regarding: 1) Whether I would accept the award, 2) what NRSA funding my sponsors and I have received, 3) who my sponsors are, 4) my home address, phone number, and citizenship status, 5) IRB information, and 6) responses to each of the critiques that my application received. I was not informed of a deadline, but it seems like, informally, I only had a week to complete it, as I started getting emails asking for it to be submitted ASAP 2 business days after I received the first email. If you get to this stage, keep in mind that they want this quickly. Information related to this request is contained within this directory.

### Products
This is entirely supplemental. It contains a few  powerpoints that I presented on the contents of the application. It is likely worthless to you, but if you find yourself wondering about the context of the research strategy, they could possibly provide some of that. 

### Summary_Statements
Contain the actual summary statements that I'd received from reviewers, which I think could maybe be enlightening as to what reviewers are generally going to be looking for, what they don't like to see, and perhaps how you can improve upon or address those concerns with later submissions, should it come to that. 

### Version_1
Again, unlikely to be the thing you're looking for here, but these were my materials that I had submitted the first time around. What I think is likely valuable here are the `Letter of Intent`, which you should send out roughly a month before you plan to submit (check the website, there is a formal deadline for this), the initial `Cover Letter`, which looks very different than the Version_2 cover letter, and some of the `99_` prefixed materials, which you need to complete on your first submission. Reach out to Julie Ehrlanger for more information on how to complete these forms. This also does contain a subdirectory called `figures`. The `ActivitiesPlanner.pptx` document might be of some interest for your `timeline` document.

### Version_2
All of the materials that I submitted that got funded. Each item is a separate .docx file and affixed with a prefix denoting the general order in which the documents should be organized. Again, the `Cover Letter` here is slightly different because it addresses criticisms of the original submission. I beleive I was past the Letter of Intent deadline at this point, so I did not submit one. You may notice that the `29Mitchell_DataManageSharePlan.docx` doesn't have a predecessor in `Version_1`. It's a new form that the NIH asks participants for.
